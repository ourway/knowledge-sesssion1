#Implementing K-means Clustering using modern Python3.

## Big Idea:
K-means is an unsupervised learning tool for identifying clusters with-in datasets.

## Alg in En:
    - Step 1: Pick an arbitrary point as guesses for the center of each group.
    - Step 2: Assign all the data points to the closest matching group.
    - Step 3: Within each group, average the points to get a new guess for the
              center of the group.
    - Step 4: Repeat multiple times, assign data and average points.
    
## Goal:
To cover the following:
    - Steps to implement an algorithm.
    - Understand what is K-mean algorithm.
    - Using short, beautiful code instead of spaghetti code.
    - ** Using Lambda, Partials, Caches, Zip stars, sampling, ...
    - ** Profiling in Python.
    - ** Compiler Optimization tricks.


## What's the roadmap?
We will follow the following steps:
    - Create a working not optimized solution.
    - Optimise it.
    - Bullet proof it (your home work maybe)

## Sample Data:
```python
points = [(10, 41, 23), (22, 30, 29), (11, 42, 5), (20, 32, 4), (12, 40, 12), (21, 36, 23)]


n = [565387674.45, 3217721030001.48009,321772103.408, 214514735.66,214514735.6005]
```
