#Implementing K-means Clustering using modern Python3.

## Big Idea:
K-means is an unsupervised learning tool for identifying clusters with-in datasets.

## Alg in En:
    - Step 1: Pick an arbitrary point as guesses for the center of each group.
    - Step 2: Assign all the data points to the closest matching group.
    - Step 3: Within each group, average the points to get a new guess for the
              center of the group.
    - Step 4: Repeat multiple times, assign data and average points.
    
## Goal:
To cover the following:
    - Steps to implement an algorithm.
    - Understand what is K-mean algorithm.
    - Using short, beautiful code instead of spaghetti code.
    - Using Lambda, Partials, Caches, Zip stars, sampling, ...
    - Profiling in Python.
    - Compiler Optimization tricks.
